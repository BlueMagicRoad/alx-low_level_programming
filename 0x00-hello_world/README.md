# Hello-World Project  
### This project contains the following scripts:    
**1. 0-preprocessor**
* Script runs a C file *$CFile* through the preprocessor and saves the result to a file *c*   
  
**2. 1-compiler**  
* Script compiles a C file *$CFile* but does not link. The output file is the same as the C file but with the extension *.o* as oppossed to *.c*  
  
**3. 2-assembler**  
* Script generates the assembly code of a C file '*$CFile* and saves it to an output file with the same name, but extension *.s* as oppossed to *.c*    
  
**4. 3-name**  
* Script compiles a C file *$Cfile* and creates an exectubale called *cisfun*    
  
**5. 4-puts.c**  
* C program that prints *"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle* using the *puts()* function 
  
**6. 5-printf.c** 
* C program that prints *with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,* using the *printf()* function  
  
**7. 6-size.c**  
* C Program prints the sizes of the *types* in bytes
  
### Additionally, the following scripts are included as solutions to the optional tasks:  
**1. 100-intel**  
* Script generates the assembly code (in intel syntax) of a C file '*$CFile* and saves it to an output file with the same name, but extension *.s* as oppossed to *.c*  
  
**2. 101-quote.c**
