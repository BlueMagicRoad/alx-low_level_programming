# Hello-World Project  
### This project contains the following scripts:    
**1. 0-preprocessor**  
* Script runs a C file *$CFile* through the preprocessor and saves the result to a file *c*  
* gcc -E $CFILE -o c  
  
**2. 1-compiler**  
* Script compiles a C file *$CFile* but does not link. The output file is the same as the C file but with the extension *.o* as oppossed to *.c*  
* gcc -c $CFILE
  
**3. 2-assembler**  
* Script generates the assembly code of a C file '*$CFile* and saves it to an output file with the same name, but extension *.s* as oppossed to *.c*  
* gcc -S $CFILE  
  
**4. 3-name**  
  
**5. 4-puts.c**
